# Classes
Classes are a way to create objects and define their behaviors in programming. They serve as blueprints for creating instances (or objects) that share common properties and methods.
# Arrow functions
Arrow functions are a concise way to write functions in JavaScript. Introduced in ES6 (ECMAScript 2015), they provide a shorter syntax compared to traditional function expressions.
# Variables 
Variables are used to store data that can be referenced and manipulated later. They act as containers for holding values, making it easier to manage and work with data throughout your code. 
# Array methods
Array methods in JavaScript are built-in functions that allow you to manipulate arrays in various ways. These methods provide powerful ways to work with data stored in arrays, making tasks like searching, filtering, transforming, and iterating over data easier and more efficient.
# Destructuring
Destructuring is a convenient way to extract values from arrays or properties from objects in JavaScript, making your code cleaner and more readable. Introduced in ES6, destructuring allows you to unpack values from data structures in a concise manner
# Modules
Modules in JavaScript are a way to organize and encapsulate code into reusable components. They help manage dependencies, maintain a clean global namespace, and enhance code maintainability.
# Ternary Operator
The ternary operator is a concise way to perform conditional logic in JavaScript (and many other programming languages). It's often used as a shorthand for if...else statements and can improve the readability of your code when used appropriately.
# Spread Operator
The spread operator in JavaScript, denoted by three consecutive dots (...), is a powerful syntax that allows you to expand or spread elements from an iterable (like an array or object) into a new context. Itâ€™s commonly used to make code more concise and expressive.
